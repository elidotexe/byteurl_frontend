## About this project

This project is an experimental app I built using Next.js 13 for the frontend and Golang for the backend.

It is a free URL shortener application that allows users to register an account, create shortened links, and track the performance of each link. This includes monitoring click count, device type, browser type, IP addresses, and the location of the audience that clicked on the links generated by the application.
